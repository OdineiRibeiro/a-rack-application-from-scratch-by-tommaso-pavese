# A Rack application from scratch by Tommaso Pavese

Yeah, I know I have did something like this [before](https://github.com/OdineiRibeiro/rails-like-app-from-ivan-shamatov). But Rack application are pure love :heart:

This one was made following the [Tommaso Pavese post list](http://tommaso.pavese.me/)

That application handle somethings a little bit different than that another application that I was made. And "why not build this one too?" I told to myself!

And this is the result!

_Ok, ok, is not completed yet, but, I'll be get this done soon!_
